# Module 1: ROS 2 Foundations

## Module Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI, humanoid robotics, and the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). Over four weeks, you'll build a solid understanding of how physical AI systems work, the architecture of humanoid robots, and the core communication patterns in ROS 2.

**Duration**: Weeks 1-4
**Prerequisites**: Basic Python programming, Linux command-line familiarity
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand the paradigm of Physical AI and its applications
- Explain humanoid robot mechanical and control systems
- Implement ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Build distributed robotic applications using ROS 2 communication

## Lessons

### [Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI](week-01-intro-physical-ai)
Explore the concept of Physical AI, embodied intelligence, and the sensor-motor loop that enables robots to interact with the physical world.

**Key Topics**: Physical AI definition, embodied AI vs. traditional AI, sensor-motor loop, real-world applications

### [Week 2: Fundamentals of Humanoid Robotics](week-02-humanoid-fundamentals)
Study the mechanical structure, actuators, sensors, and control systems that define humanoid robots.

**Key Topics**: Degrees of freedom, humanoid morphology, actuator types, sensor arrays, control hierarchies

### [Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts](week-03-ros2-architecture)
Learn the architecture of ROS 2, including the DDS middleware, graph-based communication, and quality-of-service (QoS) policies.

**Key Topics**: ROS 2 vs. ROS 1, DDS middleware, computational graph, packages and workspaces, QoS

### [Week 4: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions](week-04-ros2-nodes-topics)
Master the core ROS 2 communication patterns: nodes for computation, topics for streaming data, services for request/response, and actions for long-running tasks.

**Key Topics**: Node lifecycle, publisher/subscriber patterns, service clients/servers, action clients/servers

## Module Resources

- **Code Examples**: All ROS 2 examples tested on **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** (Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Simulation**: Gazebo Classic 11 and Gazebo Sim (Ignition Fortress)
- **Hardware**: Optional humanoid platforms (e.g., NAO, Pepper, custom builds)
- **References**: ROS 2 Documentation, Robotics textbooks, IEEE/ACM papers

## Assessment

- **Formative**: Weekly quizzes (7 questions each)
- **Hands-On**: 3 exercises per lesson (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- **Summative**: End-of-module project integrating Weeks 1-4 concepts
