# Module 2: Simulation Environments

## Module Overview

Master the three major simulation environments for robotics development: **Gazebo Classic**, **Unity Robotics**, and **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**. Learn to build virtual environments, spawn robots, simulate physics, and test algorithms before deploying to hardware.

**Duration**: Weeks 5-7
**Prerequisites**: Module 1 (ROS 2 foundations), basic 3D graphics concepts
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Configure Gazebo Classic for ROS 2 integration
- Build Unity scenes with the Unity Robotics Hub
- Leverage NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and Isaac Gym for RL
- Compare simulation environments and choose the right tool for your application

## Lessons

### [Week 5: Gazebo Simulation Basics](week-05-gazebo-basics)
Learn Gazebo Classic/Sim architecture, URDF/SDF models, physics engines, sensor plugins, and ROS 2 integration.

**Key Topics**: World files, robot models, Gazebo plugins, spawn entities, sensor simulation

### [Week 6: Unity Robotics for Simulation](week-06-unity-robotics)
Explore Unity's real-time 3D engine for robotics, integrating ROS 2 via Unity Robotics Hub, and building custom environments.

**Key Topics**: Unity Editor, ROS-TCP-Connector, URDF Importer, sensor visualization, ML-Agents integration

### [Week 7: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac Gym](week-07-nvidia-isaac)
Dive into NVIDIA's Omniverse-based simulator for ray-traced rendering, physics simulation, and reinforcement learning.

**Key Topics**: Isaac Sim interface, synthetic data generation, Isaac Gym for RL, domain randomization

## Module Resources

- **Gazebo Classic 11**: Stable release for ROS 2 Humble
- **Gazebo Sim (Ignition Fortress)**: Next-gen Gazebo with modern architecture
- **Unity 2022.3 LTS**: Long-term support version with Unity Robotics Hub
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2023.1**: Latest Omniverse-based simulator
- **Hardware**: GPU recommended (NVIDIA RTX for Isaac Sim ray tracing)

## Assessment

- **Weekly Quizzes**: 7 questions each covering simulation concepts
- **Hands-On**: Build a custom Gazebo world, Unity scene, and Isaac Sim environment
- **Capstone**: Run the same robot controller across all three simulators and compare results
